# 👋 Hej! I'm Casi

I'm a **full-stack developer** with a background in aviation, based in **Finland** 🇫🇮

## 🚀 About Me

Software developer with a foundation in **C** and **C++** from Hive Helsinki's 42 curriculum (2023-2025). I've built everything from scratch: shells, HTTP servers, raycasters, and memory allocators. That low-level experience taught me how software really works and made picking up new technologies straightforward.

These days I work across the full stack with **TypeScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, **Fastify**, and **Python**, though I naturally gravitate toward backend challenges. I enjoy optimizing performance, designing clean architectures, and solving problems that take a bit of detective work.

From aviation, I bring precision, systematic problem-solving, and the ability to stay calm under pressure. From development, I bring curiosity, adaptability, and genuine enthusiasm for building things that work.
